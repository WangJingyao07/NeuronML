**Official code for "Exploring Flexible Structure in Meta-Learning"**

ðŸ¥‡ðŸŒˆThis repository contains not only the CODE of our NeuronML but also several self-make Application cases of Neuroscience. 

*Note:* The CODE is the Pytorch version of MAML (original Tensorflow version is [CODE-maml](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml))
